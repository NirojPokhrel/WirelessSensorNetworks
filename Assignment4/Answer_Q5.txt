Q5. Explain decision for making the message type as it is.

nx_struct theft_report {
  nx_uint16_t seqno;
  nx_uint16_t pos_x;
  nx_uint16_t pos_y;
  nx_uint16_t item_type;
} ;

seqno is used to identify the sequence number of the current frame and find out the total number of theft attempt made in the item.

pos_x, pos_y: It can be used to quickly identify the location of the item so that the thief can be caught immediately after the attempt.

item_type: It can be used to identify what is the item being stolen.
